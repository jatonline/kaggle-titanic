## Summary

This is my submission to the Kaggle Titanic tutorial competition.  The task is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or died in the disaster of 15 April 1912. The data includes various information for each passenger and (in the case of the training set) labels defining the outcome for that passenger. This will be a supervised classification problem. Since this is a training exercise, there is no existing system and the object is to get as high a performing model as possible. The metric used to evaluate the model will be categorisation accuracy.

## Repo structure
* `notebooks` - contains the exploratory data analysis and modelling notebook, along with associated utility functions.
* `processed_data` - contains the Kaggle submission generated by the chosen model.
* `raw_data` - contains the raw data downloaded from Kaggle.
